# router-dorohovkaz

## Name

`router-dorohovkaz` is a combination of two words: "router" and "dorohovkaz".

The second word is a transliteration of the Ukrainian word "дороговказ", which means "road sign" or "direction sign". This name reflects the purpose of the library, which is to provide a way to manage routes and direct requests to the appropriate handlers.
